# Web tools

Six browser tools served by the Python backend in [`server/`](../server/), under
`/tools`. They cover the parts of the workflow that are easier in a browser than
on a phone: driving the signer, building and reading feeds, reading a profile,
and getting a UDID.

| Page | Purpose | Module |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /tools` | Hub linking the tools | `server/web_tools.py` |
| `GET /tools/signer` | Queue IPAs and get signed ones back, via the phone | `server/web_signer.py` |
| `GET /tools/repo-creator` | Build, validate and export an AltStore-compatible feed | `server/repo_creator.py` |
| `GET /tools/repo-decoder` | Read any source feed, normalise it, export it elsewhere | `server/repo_decoder.py` |
| `GET /tools/app-installer` | OTA install link + reachability probe for a hosted IPA | `server/app_installer.py` |
| `GET /tools/cert-check` | Read a provisioning profile's validity, team, entitlements and device scope | `server/cert_inspector.py` |
| `GET /tools/udid` | Read a device UDID through a one-time enrolment profile | `server/udid_grabber.py` |

Shared page chrome (CSS + `page()`) lives in `server/web_chrome.py`. The app
links to all of them from **Settings → Ecosystem → Web Tools**.

## 1. Signer console

A browser UI for the phone's on-device signer — the piece FlareStore has and
VexSign did not. It does **not** sign in the browser: it relays.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/tools/sign/proxy` | Read-only relay for `GET /api/{status,library,updates}` on the phone |
| `POST /api/tools/sign/sign` | Multipart IPA in, signed IPA streamed back |

Workflow: start the Web Manager on the iPhone (**Settings → Web Manager**),
paste its address (and the API token / Basic-auth pair if set) into the page,
drop in IPAs, and each one is streamed to `POST /api/sign` and streamed back as
`Signed-<name>.ipa`. A queue is supported, signed one at a time, because the
phone signs serially.

Why a relay rather than calling the phone from the page? The Web Manager sends no
CORS headers, so a cross-origin `fetch` cannot reach it — and adding
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` to a server that also accepts Basic auth would
be worse. Relaying keeps the browser call same-origin.

Guards:

- **Private networks only by default.** The target host must resolve to a
  private, loopback, link-local or CGNAT (`100.64.0.0/10`, i.e. tailnet) address,
  so this endpoint cannot be used to probe arbitrary hosts. Set
  `VEXSIGN_ALLOW_PUBLIC_TARGETS=1` only if your Web Manager genuinely has a
  public address.
- **Read-only relay.** The proxy accepts `status`, `library` and `updates` and
  nothing else — `POST /api/cleanup` is not reachable from a browser tab.
- **This server must be able to reach the phone.** Self-host on your LAN or
  tailnet. A public deployment cannot reach a phone behind NAT; that is intended.
- Nothing is stored and tokens are never logged.

## 2. Repository creator

A form for repository metadata plus a repeatable app list, with import from a
file or URL, live validation, and export.

| Endpoint | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/tools/repo/validate` | `{"draft": {…}}` | `issues[]` (`error`/`warning`, message, suggestion, app), counts |
| `POST /api/tools/repo/export` | `{"draft": {…}, "format": "altstore"\|"flat"\|"apps"}` | `filename`, pretty `json`, `errorCount` |
| `POST /api/tools/repo/ota` | `{"app": {…}, "manifestURL", "displayImageURL", "fullSizeImageURL"}` | manifest plist, `installLink` |

The validation rules mirror `VexSign/RepositoryBuilder/RepositoryValidator.swift`
(missing identifiers, non-http(s) URLs, unparseable dates, duplicate screenshots,
duplicate bundle ids), so a feed that passes here imports cleanly in the app.
`altstore` emits `versions[]` history, `flat` the Feather/ESign-style schema,
`apps` the bare `apps.json` array.

**The OTA endpoint refuses cleartext**: both the IPA URL and the manifest URL
must be `https`, because `itms-services://` will not install over http. Nothing is
uploaded or hosted — you get a manifest file and a link to paste.

Hosting the feed is your job: this server's own `POST /api/admin/apps` reads each
IPA's `Info.plist` and publishes `/repo/source.json`, or use any static HTTPS
host.

## 3. Repository decoder

Feeds have four dialects in the wild and "my repo shows up empty" is usually a
spelling mismatch. This reads all of them, maps them onto one canonical shape,
and lints the result with the Repository Creator's own validator.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/tools/repo/decode` | `{source: url}` or `{payload: text}` → format, normalised apps, issues, alias usage, stats |
| `POST /api/tools/repo/convert` | Same input plus `format` (`altstore` \| `flat` \| `apps`) → the re-exported feed |

Understood dialects: AltStore v1 `source.json`, the SideStore variant with
`versions[]`, the Feather/ESign flat schema (`bundleID`, `appDescription`,
`downloadUrl`), a bare `apps.json` array, and the legacy AltServer `appdata` XML
that this repo's own server still emits at `/repo/appdata`.

`aliasesUsed` reports which non-canonical spellings were mapped, so a broken feed
shows you the key it got wrong instead of just an empty list. Fetches are capped
at 4 MiB, follow redirects only over http(s), and are never stored.

## 4. App installer

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/tools/install/manifest` | `{ipaURL, manifestURL, name, bundleIdentifier, version, size, probe}` → manifest plist, `itms-services://` link, issues |
| `POST /api/tools/install/probe` | `{ipaURL}` → status, content type, length, redirect chain, installability verdict |

The probe exists because the two failure modes that waste an afternoon are
invisible in the plist: a host that answers `HEAD` with 405 (a ranged `GET` is
tried instead), and a URL that redirects to cleartext, which iOS refuses silently
while the device just spins. `Content-Length` also fills in the size field when
you do not know it.

Both URLs must be https or the request is rejected with 422. Nothing is hosted
here — you get a `manifest.plist` for your own HTTPS host and the link.

## 5. Certificate status checker

Parses what a provisioning profile actually says, and nothing more.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /api/tools/cert/inspect` | multipart upload of a `.mobileprovision` (or public `.cer`/`.pem`) → status, team, App ID, entitlements, device count, expiry countdown, fingerprints, revocation lookup |
| `GET /api/tools/cert/revoked-list` | the curated list this deployment consults |

The page parses the profile **in the browser** (the plist is extracted from the
CMS blob and read with `DOMParser`); the upload button is opt-in for people who
want the server's parse and revocation lookup.

Status is computed from the profile's own validity window: `valid`, `expiring`
(≤30 days), `critical` (≤7 days), `expired`.

Hard limits, by design:

- **No `.p12`, no password.** The endpoint has no password field and rejects
  `.p12`/`.pfx` uploads with a 422. There is nothing to leak.
- **Apple is never queried.** "Revoked" means *listed in
  `server/data/revoked_certs.json` on this deployment*; an unlisted certificate
  is reported as **unknown**, never as valid. See
  [`server/data/README.md`](../server/data/README.md) for the format.
- **Parsing is not verification.** The plist is read out of the signed blob; that
  says nothing about who signed it.
- **Public certificates** (`.cer`/`.pem`) get subject, issuer, validity, CA flag
  and fingerprints when the optional `cryptography` package is installed, and
  fingerprints alone when it is not. It is not in `requirements.txt` on purpose —
  the profile path, which is the common case, is pure stdlib.

## 6. UDID grabber

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /tools/udid` | page; creates a one-time session token |
| `GET /api/tools/udid/profile?token=…` | the enrolment `.mobileconfig` |
| `POST /api/udid/callback?token=…` | where iOS posts the signed attribute plist |
| `GET /api/tools/udid/session/{token}` | the page polls this for the UDID |

The profile is a standard *Profile Service* payload (`PayloadType = Profile
Service`, `PayloadVersion = 1`) asking for `DEVICE_UDID`, `DEVICE_NAME`,
`PRODUCT`, `SERIAL`, `VERSION`, `IMEI` and `MEID`. iOS posts the result back as a
raw CMS-signed plist; the callback pulls the plist out of the body and stores the
attributes against the token.

Guards:

- Sessions live in process memory for **15 minutes**, capped at **200** (oldest
  evicted first). Nothing is written to disk and no UDID is logged.
- An expired session's callback gets **410 Gone** and the UDID is discarded.
- A response without a UDID gets **422**, so a malformed post cannot mark a
  session as received.
- The token is a bearer secret: whoever holds the page URL sees the UDID posted
  to it.
- The generated profile is **unsigned**, so iOS says so. Sign it with your own
  certificate to remove the warning.
- Install flow on iOS 16+: Settings → *Profile Downloaded* → Install; remove it
  afterwards.

## Deployment

Nothing extra is required: the tools ship with `server/main.py` and are mounted
by `app.include_router(web_tools_router)`. Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` if your proxy
does not forward `X-Forwarded-Host`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` — the UDID callback URL
is built from it (see `server/request_base.py`, the single implementation shared
with the premium API).

```sh
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000   # then open http://localhost:8000/tools
```

`httpx` (pinned in `requirements.txt`) is the one dependency the tools add: the
signer console relays to the phone, the decoder fetches feeds and the installer
probes URLs, all of which need streaming.

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | inferred from forwarding headers | Absolute base for generated URLs (UDID callback, OTA links) |
| `VEXSIGN_ALLOW_PUBLIC_TARGETS` | off | Let the signer relay reach non-private hosts |

Tests: 63 cases across `server/tests/test_web_tools.py` (25) and
`server/tests/test_signer_decoder_installer.py` (38). The new file covers the
target guard (private allowed, public refused, env override), read-only relay
enforcement, upstream 401/412 passthrough, the streamed signed IPA and its
filename, all five feed dialects, alias normalisation, validator errors, the
4 MiB fetch cap, dialect conversion, https-only manifests, and every probe
outcome (HEAD ok, HEAD refused → GET, 404, HTML body, cleartext redirect,
connection failure). Outbound calls go through `httpx.MockTransport`, so the
suite never touches the network.

```sh
cd server && python -m pytest tests/ -q     # 85 passed in total
