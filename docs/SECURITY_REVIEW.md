# Security review — VexSign

Scope: the areas the app exposes to untrusted input and secrets handling —
IPA/TIPA/deb archive extraction, repository (source) URLs and redirects,
certificate/password handling, downloaded tweak and dylib validation,
repository transport security, security-scoped resources, diagnostics
exposure and temporary storage lifetime.

Status legend: **fixed** (change landed in this pass), **verified** (reviewed,
adequate as-is), **documented** (accepted risk / behavior explained).

## 1. Archive extraction (IPA / TIPA / deb / tar) — FIXED

**Attack surface.** `Decompression.swift` untars `.deb` payloads and tweak
archives; `AR.swift` parses `ar` archives; `Zip` extracts IPA/TIPA bundles.
Archive entry names are attacker-controlled strings.

**Findings & fixes.**

- *Path traversal (`../` and absolute names)* — the tar loop previously kept a
  single `standardizedFileURL` prefix check. It now rejects, before any write:
  absolute paths, any `..` component, `~`-relative names, backslash separators
  (Windows drive/path tricks), and NUL bytes (`_isSafeArchiveEntryName`).
  The prefix check stays as a backstop. Skipped entries are logged under the
  `Security` log category (surfaced in the Diagnostics Center).
- *Symlink / hardlink / device / FIFO entries* — only `.regular` files and
  `.directory` entries are materialized; every other entry type is skipped
  and logged. A symlink can therefore never be written into the extraction
  tree, which was the classic "link now, write through it later" escape.
- *Zip extraction* — handled by the `Zip` dependency (ZIPFoundation-based);
  its sanitization was reviewed and it strips absolute paths and `..`
  components on extraction.

**Tests.** `StabilityAndArchitectureTests.testUnsafeArchiveEntryNamesAreRejected`.

## 2. Repository URLs and redirects — FIXED / VERIFIED

**Findings & fixes.**

- *Transport policy* — repositories must now use **HTTPS** end to end:
  adding a source (`FR.handleSource`, `Storage.addSource`) and every refresh
  (`SourcesViewModel`) validate the URL through `SourceURLPolicy`. `http://`
  is only allowed after an explicit, clearly-labeled opt-in
  (Settings → Security → *Allow Insecure HTTP Sources*, default off).
  Non-HTTP(S) schemes (`file:`, `ftp:`, …) are never accepted. Restoring a
  user's own backup re-adds their saved sources, but those sources are still
  not refreshed until the opt-in is enabled.
- *Redirects* — `URLSession` follows redirects but never changes the scheme
  except to HTTPS upgrades announced by the server; ATS applies. Catalog
  fetches use the same default `URLSession` with ATS on (no exceptions are
  registered anywhere in the app — verified by grep).
- *Catalog content* — repository JSON is decoded with a strict
  `JSONDecoder` into `ASRepository`; decode failures are recorded per source
  and never crash the store. Raw payloads are cached to disk only as the
  already-fetched JSON (no headers/credentials are persisted).

## 3. Certificate and password handling — VERIFIED

- Certificate passwords live in the **Keychain** (`CertificateSecrets`,
  `SecureSecretStore`) with read-through migration that *fails closed* if the
  Keychain is unavailable; the Core Data `password` field is nulled after
  migration.
- No password values are logged (grep audit of all `Logger`/`print` sites —
  only error descriptions and certificate names appear).
- The `vexsign://import-certificate` URL scheme accepts p12/profile/password
  in the query string — this is by design (compatibility with Feather), but
  passwords never reach logs, history or the task center.

## 4. Downloaded tweaks and dylibs — VERIFIED / DOCUMENTED

Downloaded `.dylib`/`.deb`/`.framework` components are stored in the app
sandbox and injected at sign time; they are never executed by VexSign
itself. Mach-O parsing (`MachO/`) is defensive against malformed binaries
(bounded reads, type-safe header access). Injection always happens under the
user's own certificate, so a malicious dylib's blast radius is the signed
app — VexSign adds no entitlements the profile doesn't grant.

## 5. Security-scoped resources — VERIFIED

All `startAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` call sites are paired with
`defer { stopAccessing… }` (FR.swift certificate import/check, HomeView
drag&drop, OnboardingView import). `BackupArchive` cleans its work directory
in `deinit`.

## 6. Diagnostics and backups — VERIFIED

- The diagnostics bundle (`DiagnosticBundleExporter`) ships sanitized logs
  and certificate **metadata** only — no private keys, no passwords
  (explicit `_sanitize` pass over logs, plus summaries that exclude
  secrets).
- Backups: certificates (including Keychain passwords for restore) are only
  written into a backup when the user provides a password — the backup is
  AES-GCM sealed with a PBKDF2 (SHA256, 200k iterations, 16-byte salt) key.
  An empty password produces an explicitly unencrypted container; the UI
  labels both paths. Recommendation retained: prefer always setting a
  password when certificates are included.

## 7. Temporary storage lifetime — FIXED

- Signing (`VexSigning_*`), backup (`VexBackup*`) and diagnostics
  (`DiagnosticBundle*`) working directories live under the system temp
  directory, which iOS purges under pressure — but a hard kill previously
  left complete app bundles there indefinitely.
- `TempStorageSweeper` now runs during `EcosystemMaintenance` (launch and
  background refresh) and removes VexSign-owned temp directories older than
  24 hours. It only touches well-known prefixes and never an in-flight run.
- `SigningHandler.clean()` also removes moved-but-unregistered bundles so
  they cannot leak from a failed sign.

## 8. Repository snapshot cache — VERIFIED (new)

The offline catalog cache (`Application Support/SourceSnapshots/`) stores the
raw catalog JSON per source, capped at 64 snapshots, evicting by age, and is
pruned to installed sources after every refresh. It contains no credentials.

## Remaining recommendations

1. Pin or verify repository TLS certificates (e.g. allow users to "trust" a
   source's cert fingerprint) — currently standard ATS validation applies.
2. Add a download-size cap for catalog JSON (defense against a hostile
   multi-gigabyte "catalog").
3. Consider per-source cookie isolation if authenticated sources ever share
   a session (not the case today; `NBFetchService` sends only explicit
   headers plus an optional `X-API-Key`).
