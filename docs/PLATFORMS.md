# Companion platforms: Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, Apple Watch

VexSign's signing engine lives on iPhone/iPad: that is where the certificate, the
IPA storage, Zsign and `installd` are. The three targets in this document are
**companions** — they show what the phone is doing and can trigger work on it.
None of them signs, installs or stores apps, and none of them pretends to.

| Target | Platform | What it is | How it talks to the iPhone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VexSignTV` | tvOS 17+ | Big-screen mirror: certificate countdown, counts, pending updates, library | Web Manager REST API over the local network |
| `VexSignVision` | visionOS 2+ | Spatial mirror with glass panels and an ornament control bar | Web Manager REST API over the local network |
| `VexSignWatch` | watchOS 10+ | Wrist mirror plus four remote commands | WatchConnectivity (push snapshot, queue commands) |
| `VexSignWatchWidgets` | watchOS 10+ | Complication: certificate days left, app/update counts | Reads the app group the watch app fills |

## Shared code

`VexSign/Companion/` is compiled into several targets through the same
membership-exception mechanism the widget extension already uses:

| File | iOS | tvOS | visionOS | watchOS | watch widget |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| `CompanionModels.swift` (wire format) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `CompanionClient.swift` (Web Manager reader) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| `CompanionStore.swift` (view model) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | — |
| `WatchSnapshotStore.swift` (app-group hand-off) | — | — | — | ✅ | ✅ |

These files import Foundation (plus SwiftUI/Combine in the store) and nothing
else, which is what keeps them portable. Anything that touches UIKit, Core Data
or the signer stays in the iOS target.

## Apple TV

`VexSignTV/` — one screen, focus-first: certificate hero card, four count tiles,
pending updates, library grid.

**Pairing:** open VexSign on the iPhone → *Settings → Web Manager* → start the
server, then enter the printed address (and API token, if one is set) in
*Settings → Companion Devices → Apple TV & Vision Pro*… or simply type it into
the TV app's connect screen. There is no auto-discovery: the Web Manager does not
advertise a Bonjour service, and guessing addresses is worse than asking.

**What it reads:** `GET /api/status`, `GET /api/library`, `GET /api/updates` —
the automation endpoints that already existed. No new server surface was added
for the companions.

**Refresh:** on appear, on demand, and every 30 seconds by default
(`autoRefreshInterval`, settable in the store). A failed refresh keeps the last
good snapshot on screen instead of blanking.

## Apple Vision Pro

`VexSignVision/` — a spatial window: certificate panel and counts on the left,
updates and library in a scrollable glass column on the right, with an ornament
holding *Refresh* and *Connection*. Same client, same endpoints, same store as
Apple TV; only the views differ.

Immersive spaces and volumes are deliberately not used: there is nothing to show
in 3D that a panel cannot show better, and an immersive space would hide the
numbers this app exists to display.

## Apple Watch

`VexSignWatch/` — certificate countdown, app/signed/update counts, and four
buttons that run on the phone:

| Command | What runs on the iPhone |
| --- | --- |
| Refresh repositories | `SourcesViewModel.fetchSources(refresh: true)` |
| Check certificates | `BatchCertChecker.checkAll(online: false)` — local only |
| Update all apps | `BackgroundAutomation.run(fromBackground: true)` |
| Clean now | `CleanupManager.cleanNow()` |

Each is the same call the matching App Intent makes, so there is one
implementation per action, not two.

**Transport:** `CompanionBridge` (iPhone) pushes a `CompanionSnapshot` with
`updateApplicationContext`, so the watch has numbers even if its app was never
opened, and sends a direct message when reachable. The watch replies with
`sendMessage` when the phone is reachable and `transferUserInfo` otherwise, so a
command pressed out of range is queued rather than dropped.

**Opt-in:** the bridge only activates when *Settings → Companion Devices → Apple
Watch companion* is on. It is off by default because activating a `WCSession` on
every launch is not free.

**Complication:** `VexSignWatchWidgets` renders the certificate countdown in the
circular, rectangular, corner and inline families. Widget extensions cannot open
a `WCSession`, so the watch app mirrors every snapshot into the
`group.com.vexsign.watch` app group (`WatchSnapshotStore`) and the complication
reads it from there.

## Building

```sh
xcodebuild -workspace VexSign.xcworkspace -scheme VexSignTV \
  -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS Simulator' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

xcodebuild -workspace VexSign.xcworkspace -scheme VexSignVision \
  -destination 'generic/platform=visionOS Simulator' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build

xcodebuild -workspace VexSign.xcworkspace -scheme VexSignWatch \
  -destination 'generic/platform=watchOS Simulator' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

`.github/workflows/platform-check.yml` runs exactly these three builds on macOS
runners whenever a companion target, `VexSign/Companion/` or the project file
changes.

The watch app is embedded in the iPhone app by an *Embed Watch Content* build
phase on the `VexSign` target, and the watch widget is embedded in the watch app
by its own *Embed Foundation Extensions* phase — so building the iOS app builds
the watch pair with it.

## Known limits (honest list)

- **No signing anywhere but iOS.** Zsign, the certificate store and `installd`
  are iOS-only. A companion that claimed to sign would be lying.
- **No app icons in the new asset catalogs.** `VexSignTV/`, `VexSignVision/`,
  `VexSignWatch/` and `VexSignWatchWidgets/` ship an empty `Assets.xcassets`;
  Xcode uses its placeholder icon. Add real icons before shipping.
- **Provisioning.** The new targets use `CODE_SIGN_STYLE = Manual` with an empty
  team, like the widget target, so unsigned CI builds work. Distributing them
  needs profiles for `com.vexsign.app.tv`, `.vision`, `.watch` and
  `.watch.widgets`, plus the `group.com.vexsign.watch` app group on the two watch
  bundles.
- **The TV/vision companions need the Web Manager running.** iOS suspends the
  server when the phone locks unless *Keep alive* is on; a companion then shows
  the last snapshot and a staleness indicator rather than fresh data.
- **Watch reachability is Apple's call.** Commands may take until the next
  in-range moment; the UI says so instead of pretending they ran.
- **Not device-tested here.** These targets compile in CI (macOS runners) but the
  layout, focus behaviour, complication sizing and WatchConnectivity hand-off
  still need a run on real hardware or simulators.
